**Domain of interest**
**As we've discussed, data science can expose underlying patterns in any domain that uses or collects data (which is nearly any domain). Anything from the forced relocation of homeless individuals (Links to an external site.) to how people gender representation (Links to an external site.) in the media, data can expose interesting (and actionable) patterns. In this section, you'll identify a domain that you are interested in (e.g., music, education, dance, immigration -- any field of your interest) and answer the following questions in your README.md file:**

**Why are you interested in this field/domain?**

We are interested in mental health statistics due to COVID-19 because of the current situation we are living in. Now more than ever are we more aware of taking care of one's mental health.


**What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?**

[This article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/05/04/mental-health-coronavirus/ ) talks about how the rise of COVID cases is also causing people to suffer from more mental health issues and those who already suffer making it worse for them.

[This article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7413844/)
talks about systemic search was conducted to investigate the impact COVID-19 had on the mental health of the general population.


[This article](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/people-with-covid-19-more-likely-to-develop-depression-anxiety-and-dementia)
talked about how 1 in 5 people who contracted Covid-19 were likely to have depression or anxiety months after they test positive.


**What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?**

--Has the rise amount of COVID cases also impacted the rise of mental health issues within a certain region?

--Has the rise in mental health issues during the pandemic lead to a rise in people seeking help or resources?

--Is there a certain age group that has been most affected by mental health issues due to the pandemic?


We strongly suggest that you complete this section first, discussing what you might want to learn, then move forward with the data discovery process.

**Finding Data**

**We are lucky enough to live in a time when there is lots of publicly available data made possible by governments, journalists, academics, and companies. In this section, you will identify and download at least 3 sources of data related to your domain of interest described above (into a folder you create called data/). You won't be required to use all of these sources, but it will give you practice discovering data. If your data is made available through a Web API, you don't need to download it. For each source of data, provide the following information:**

**Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?**

We got the data from this [website](https://www.vox.com/22174464/covid-cases-anxiety-depression-mental-health).

**How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?**

We are downloading the data that is given to us on a an Excel sheet and moving it to R Studio once it is organized and complete. The data from this website shows different graphs, one about the mental health of Americans during the early summer and the other is the amount of Covid-19 cases found in the US.  The mental health graph was collected by the CDC Household plus survey, and the Covid-19 graph comes from the NYT collecting data on positive cases per day. The graph tries to correlate the rise/decrease in cases with the rise/decreases in the mental health crisis.


**How many observations (rows) are in your data?**

Both data have 12 rows.


**How many features (columns) are in the data?**

Both data have 12 rows.


**What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**

This answers the first question we asked which is, has the rise in COVID cases also impacted the rise of mental health issues within a certain region?

--------

**Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?**

We got the data from this [website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/mental-health.htm
).

**How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?**

We downloaded the data from the website url that was exported to a CSV file into Excel to test out the process of downloading data.
The data online can be accessed from the CDC website. The National Center for Health Statistics worked together with the Census Bureau to create the Household Pulse Survey. The data is centered on the impact the coronavirus pandemic has had in the United States relating to the frequency of anxiety and depression symptoms. The survey set to collect information about adults across the U.S.

**How many observations (rows) are in your data?**

There are 4735 observations.

**How many features (columns) are in the data?**

There are 12 features.

**What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**

Questions related to age groups like our third question: Is there a certain age group that has been most affected by mental health issues due to the pandemic? There is a possibility of answering our first question as well in terms of the United States: Has the rise in COVID cases also impacted the rise of mental health issues within a certain region?

**Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?**

We got the data from this [website](https://data.world/associatedpress/covid-impact-survey-public-data/workspace/file?filename=03_June_9_covid_impact_survey.csv).

**How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?**

We downloaded the data from a website url and then an excel with all of the data.
The data was generated from a survey that people took, and the data is mainly about people's personal experiences and how they were affected and feeling as covid began to impact our lives.

**How many observations (rows) are in your data?**

There were 7,505 rows in table.


**How many features (columns) are in the data?**

There were 178 columns.


**What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**

With this dataset the questions that can be answered are how people’s personal life was impacted and how they were feeling which correlates directly to our question of did covid impact one’s mental health due to the covid restrictions.
